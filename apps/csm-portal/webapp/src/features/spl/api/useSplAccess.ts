// Whether the signed-in user should see the SPL (Support Portal Lite)
// section at all — the "is this Sales/SA staff" audience gate, distinct
// from useSplPermissions.ts's fine-grained action gates.
//
// DELIBERATE EXCEPTION, see useAsgardeoGroups.ts's own doc comment: reads
// Asgardeo groups client-side rather than this app's usual backend-`roles`
// pattern. Chosen explicitly for the SPL merge rather than extending
// GET /users/me — see the merge plan for the trade-off.
//
// Real enforcement is server-side: every /spl/* route on the Go backend
// re-checks SPL_ALLOWED_GROUPS from the JWT (internal/splauth). A caller
// who reaches an SPL screen without the group sees a 403 from every call
// it makes, same as any other tampered/stale-claim scenario in this app.
